# drapak-reddit-spring-hibernate
drapak-reddit app rewritten using modern tools 
 
 
The app has almost identical functionality as the drapak-reddit. Credentials for database and Reddit registerd app should be filled in private.properties file. This app will be the one that will be extended and debugged instead of the other one as the other one has been developed for training purposes. Right now the core functionality has been rewritten and the app works. It still needs debugging and testing. It has been developed using Spring Boot, Hibernate, Spring Data.
